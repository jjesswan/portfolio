                        <h3>raytracing</h3> <br><br>
                        Raytracing is a method of rendering that simulates the physical 
                        pathway of light, allowing for extremely realistic lighting 
                        effects during the first render pass. In this project, 
                        I utilized the Phong Illumination Model in order to calculate 
                        lighting effects, as well as recursive raytracing to compute both 
                        shadowed (one pass) and reflective surfaces (several passes). 
                        Finally, I implemented UV coordinate mapping in order to render 
                        each surface under texture maps specific to each shape, taking
                         into account color blending and lighting effects overlaid on top of textures.

                        <h3>diamond in the sea</h3> <br><br>
                        A real-time underwater scene which features height mapping, 
                        scrolling textures and displacement mapping, pixelation and 
                        outline shaders, rotating shapes, transparency, and texture
                         mapping using GLSL shaders.  <br><br><br>

                        During this project, we wanted to focus on exploring 
                        different post-processing techniques made possible with 
                        the OpenGL library and GLSL shaders. Pixelation with outline 
                        filtering was accomplished through two post-processing passes 
                        to our initial rendered scene, in which two shaders and two 
                        framebuffer objects (FBOs) sampled from the texture output 
                        of the other in order to render our final product. Additionally, 
                        inspired by Evan Wallace’s work with realistic water movement, 
                        we implemented displacement mapping and height mapping to 
                        achieve scrolling water with height variation on a 3d plane.

                        <h3>real-time graphics</h3> <br><br>
                        Similar to Raytracing, the real-time graphics pipeline 
                        renders 3D scenes with realistic lighting. However, while
                         the realistic quality of rendered images is decreased 
                         due to the lack of precision that raytracing allows, 
                         real-time rendering is more time-efficient and allows for 
                         camera manipulation and movement. In addition, the tesselation 
                         of each shape type can be adjusted according to a GUI slider 
                         in real-time. This application makes use of OpenGL API and the 
                         real-time graphics pipeline, as well as multiple post-processing 
                         effects using framebuffer objects and custom shaders.

                        multiple types of brushes, allowing users to paint on a 
                        2D canvas with RGBA values, as well as apply filters on

                        Integrated Javascript with Qualtrics API in order to protect 
                        the session privacy of high school students and hide sensitive data 
                        during a district-wide survey. Students were each provided with 
                        unique access codes registered with the administration system, 
                        and could only log into the survey via their access code. 
                        If students went idle (no mouse movement, clicks, or scrolling 
                        either on desktop or mobile), a pause screen displayed while 
                        the rest of the survey locked, preventing other students or 
                        passing individuals from being able to see student answers. 
                        In order to resume the survey, students must provide the same 
                        access code they began the survey with. Otherwise, after 10 minutes, 
                        the student was logged out completely and brought back to the 
                        survey home page. <br><br><br>
                        
                        This idle and pause screen was use in several 
                        student-facing surveys in multiple school districts by the 
                        Brown School of Public Health’s Survey Research Center.
